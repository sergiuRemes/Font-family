Different ways to index font-families in HTML

If you guys are new to HTML, this are different ways of how to add font-families to your html file. 
Don't mind the colors on the table, I was esperimenting with the css.
By the way, in the .css there is 2 ways of working with table inner borders. I used rounded border using the "border-radius" property. On the line above is shown how to remove double borders, I commented the line of code.
